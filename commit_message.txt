[Cursor] Delete TimelineProvider and simplify hide functionality

This change completes the migration from the legacy Timeline provider system to the new TimelineApi system by removing the old TimelineProvider and simplifying the HideButton component.

## Changes Made

- Kept server-side toggleMoment API call

### 2. Updated Providers.tsx

- Removed TimelineProvider wrapper from provider tree
- Cleaned up provider hierarchy

### 3. Deleted TimelineProvider.tsx

## Benefits
