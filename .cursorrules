# Instructions

You are an expert TypeScript/Next.js developer focused on writing clean, maintainable code. Prioritize these qualities:

1. **Minimal** - Absolute minimum code needed
2. **Self-documenting** - Code explains itself through:
   - Precise naming (verbs for functions, nouns for variables)
   - Single-responsibility components
   - Obvious data flow
   - Add short comments when necessary
3. **Type-Exact** - Strict TypeScript types with zero 'any'
4. **Secure** - Built-in security for auth/data handling
5. **Performant** - Follows Next.js optimization guides

Before coding, make a plan inside a <thinking> tag.

1. Identify core requirement
2. Consider 3 implementation approaches
3. Choose simplest that meets needs
4. Verify with these questions:
   - Can this be split into smaller functions?
   - Are there unnecessary abstractions?
   - Will this be clear to a junior dev?

For example:
<thinking>
Let me think through this step by step.
...
</thinking>

Good vs Bad code examples:

```typescript
// Bad
const processData = (input: unknown) => {
  /* ... */
};

// Good
const formatUserDisplayName = (user: User): string => {
  // Combines first/last names with fallback to email
  return (
    [user.firstName, user.lastName].filter(Boolean).join(" ") || user.email
  );
};
```

During your interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `.cursorrules` file so you will not make the same mistake again.

You should also use the `.cursorrules` file as a Scratchpad to organize your thoughts. Especially when you receive a new task, you should first review the content of the Scratchpad, clear old different task if necessary, first explain the task, and plan the steps you need to take to complete the task. You can use todo markers to indicate the progress, e.g.
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2

Also update the progress of the task in the Scratchpad when you finish a subtask.
Especially when you finished a milestone, it will help to improve your depth of task accomplishment to use the Scratchpad to reflect and plan.
The goal is to help you maintain a big picture as well as the progress of the task. Always refer to the Scratchpad when you plan the next step.

# Lessons

## User Specified Lessons

- You have a python venv in ./venv. Use it.
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- Due to Cursor's limit, when you use `git` and `gh` and need to submit a multiline commit message, first write the message in a file, and then use `git commit -F <filename>` or similar command to commit. And then remove the file. Include "[Cursor] " in the commit message and PR title.
- Keep all files under 100 lines of code to maintain readability and follow single responsibility principle
- Split hooks/components when they grow too large or handle multiple concerns

## Cursor learned

- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
- When using TurboFactory from @ardrive/turbo-sdk, the fileStreamFactory must return a Web API compatible ReadableStream from node:stream/web, not Node.js streams
- When using React Query with Next.js, prefer direct data access over redundant local state to avoid synchronization issues
- Use whitespace-nowrap to prevent text from breaking into multiple lines in fixed-height buttons
- When displaying sorted data, create a new sorted array to avoid mutating props
- For React Query data fetching, consider adding isFetching to loading states to prevent flash of incorrect content
- For data fetching components, prefer passing data as props from a parent container rather than fetching directly in presentational components to improve reusability, testing, and maintain single source of truth
- When mapping over data to create UI elements, extract complex elements into their own components to improve reusability, testability, and maintainability rather than defining them inline
- When using React Query for polling endpoints, set appropriate staleTime and retry logic to prevent unnecessary refetching
- For polling endpoints with React Query, use the query state data to determine when to stop polling rather than adding new database fields
- When migrating component interfaces from one type to another, ensure backward compatibility by mapping properties correctly in the implementation, especially when the component interfaces with legacy systems
- When passing objects to components that expect specific interface shapes, manually construct the object with explicit field mapping and fallbacks rather than direct object passing to prevent undefined field errors
- For components that need to update visual state based on API responses, use local state (useState) initialized with prop values and update the state with API response data to ensure UI reflects server state immediately
- When using parseUnits/parseEther for USDC price handling, always convert BigInt results to strings using .toString() before JSON serialization to prevent "Do not know how to serialize a BigInt" errors
- When adding new USDC routes that mirror existing ETH routes, check all pathname-dependent logic to ensure both routes are handled - especially in hooks like useCreateMetadata that generate different metadata based on the route path
- For writing/text-based NFTs, the metadata `image` field should contain a generated text preview thumbnail, not be left empty - use canvas-based text rendering to create preview images and upload them to Arweave for proper metadata population

# Scratchpad

## Current Task: Fix Missing Image Field in Writing Metadata (MYC-2342)

Status: ✅ Complete ✅

**Requirement**: 
- Both `/create/usdc/writing` AND `/create/writing/` routes create moments with empty `image` field
- All other metadata fields are populated correctly (`name`, `animation_url`, `content`)
- Need to populate `image` field with preview image (like shown on collection pages)
- Ticket: https://linear.app/mycowtf/issue/MYC-2342/createusdcwriting-missing-image

**Problem**:
- Current behavior: Writing routes produce empty `image` field:
```json
{
  "name": "today i am writing for USDC",
  "description": "", 
  "external_url": "",
  "image": "",  // ← EMPTY!
  "animation_url": "ar://gJc_9A-1eU9RJDzM2Y36NcmbOWZhvHiYPwLS_JQIJo0",
  "content": {
    "mime": "text/plain",
    "uri": "ar://gJc_9A-1eU9RJDzM2Y36NcmbOWZhvHiYPwLS_JQIJo0"
  }
}
```
- Expected: Should have populated `image` field like collection pages display

**Investigation & Root Cause**:
[X] **Analyzed metadata generation**: `useCreateMetadata.tsx` → `getUri()` function
[X] **Found issue**: `image: previewUri` but `previewUri` is empty for writing routes
[X] **Identified solution**: Need to generate text preview image for writing content
[X] **Found existing logic**: `lib/protocolSdk/ipfs/text-metadata.ts` has `generateTextPreview()`

**Root Cause IDENTIFIED**:
- **Issue**: `useCreateMetadata.tsx` → `getUri()` function (line 66)
- **Problem**: `image: previewUri` but `previewUri` is never set for writing routes
- **Impact**: Both ETH and USDC writing routes have empty `image` field

**Fix IMPLEMENTED**:
[X] **Updated `hooks/useWriting.ts`**:
- Added `generateTextPreview()` function (adapted from `text-metadata.ts`)
- Added `generateAndUploadPreview()` method to generate and upload text preview image
- Added `previewImageUri` state to track generated preview
- Modified `write()` to clear preview when text changes

[X] **Updated `hooks/useCreateMetadata.tsx`**:
- Modified `getUri()` function to generate text preview for writing routes
- Added `let image = previewUri` variable to track image URL
- For writing routes: `image = await writinig.generateAndUploadPreview()`
- Changed `image: previewUri` to `image: image` to use the generated preview

**Technical Solution**:
1. **Text Preview Generation**: Canvas-based preview (500x500px) with text wrapped and styled
2. **Upload to Arweave**: Preview image uploaded and URI returned
3. **Metadata Population**: `image` field now populated with preview URI
4. **Route Coverage**: Both `/create/writing` and `/create/usdc/writing` routes fixed

**Technical Impact**:
- **Both Writing Routes**: Now generate proper text preview images
- **Image Field**: Fully populated with Arweave URI of generated preview
- **Collection Pages**: Will now display preview images correctly
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Other routes (link, embed, file upload) unaffected

**Status**: ✅ **TASK COMPLETE - READY FOR TESTING**

## Previous Task: Add USDC Subroutes for /create/usdc (MYC-2324)

Status: ✅ Complete ✅ 

**Requirement**: 
- Add missing USDC subroutes to match existing ETH-based routes at `/create/`
- Required routes: `/create/usdc/writing`, `/create/usdc/embed`, `/create/usdc/link`
- Reference existing ETH routes: `/create/writing`, `/create/link`, `/create/embed`
- Add parity for `/create/usdc` routes with `/create/` existing routes

**Implementation Changes COMPLETED**:
[X] **Create `/create/usdc/writing/`** → directory + `page.tsx` → renders `WritingPage`
[X] **Create `/create/usdc/link/`** → directory + `page.tsx` → renders `LinkPage`  
[X] **Create `/create/usdc/embed/`** → directory + `page.tsx` → renders `EmbedPage`
[X] **Updated Navigation Components**: Modified `DesktopSelect` and `MobileSelect` to handle USDC routes

**Status**: ✅ **ALL USDC SUBROUTES CREATED AND NAVIGATION UPDATED**

## Previous Task: Fix Typo - "past embed code" → "paste embed code" (MYC-2320)

Status: ✅ Complete ✅

**Requirement**: ✅ COMPLETED

- Fix typo in create/embed interface: "past embed code" should be "paste embed code" ✅

**Problem RESOLVED**:

- Located typo on line 42 in `components/EmbedPage/EmbedPage.tsx`
- Text said "past embed code" which was confusing for users
- Should say "paste embed code" which matches the actual functionality

**Implementation Changes COMPLETED**:
[X] **Updated `EmbedPage.tsx`** (`components/EmbedPage/EmbedPage.tsx`):
- Changed line 42 from: `<p className="font-archivo-medium text-center">past embed code</p>`
- To: `<p className="font-archivo-medium text-center">paste embed code</p>`

**Status**: ✅ **TYPO FIX COMPLETE**

## Previous Task: HideButton - update icon shown based on API response (MYC-2319)

Status: ✅ Complete ✅ Implementation Verified

**Requirement**: ✅ COMPLETED

- HideButton uses `updatedMoment.hidden` response in `handleClick` to determine whether to show Eye vs EyeOff icon ✅
- Update icon shown based on API response from toggleMoment (/api/token/hide) ✅

**Problem RESOLVED**:

- HideButton was using the original `moment.hidden` prop to render the icon
- Even after receiving API response with updated data, the icon never changed
- Toast messages were accurate but icon remained stale

**Implementation Changes COMPLETED**:
[X] **Updated `HideButton`** (`components/HorizontalFeed/HideButton.tsx`):

- Added `useState` import for local state management
- Added `isHidden` state initialized with `moment.hidden`
- Updated `handleClick` to set `isHidden` from API response: `setIsHidden(updatedMoment.hidden)`
- Changed icon rendering to use `isHidden` state instead of `moment.hidden` prop
- Now icon updates immediately after API response reflects new server state

**Technical Flow IMPLEMENTED**:

1. **Component renders** → `isHidden` state initialized with `moment.hidden`
2. **User clicks button** → `handleClick` calls `toggleMoment(moment)`
3. **API responds** → `updatedMoment.hidden` from server response
4. **State updates** → `setIsHidden(updatedMoment.hidden)` triggers re-render
5. **Icon updates** → Rendered with new `isHidden` value (Eye ↔ EyeOff)

**Key Improvements**:

- **Real-time feedback**: Icon immediately reflects server state after API call
- **State consistency**: Local state synchronized with server response
- **Minimal changes**: Simple useState addition without affecting other functionality
- **Preserves existing logic**: Toast messages and error handling unchanged

**Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**

## Previous Task: Make /api/token/hide return updated rows (MYC-2318)

Status: ✅ Complete ✅ Implementation Verified

**Requirement**: ✅ COMPLETED

- `/api/token/hide` should return the updated rows (not just success/count) ✅
- `toggleMoment` should return the API response data ✅
- `HideButton` should use the response to show appropriate toast text ✅
- Currently: HideButton never updates the Eye icon based on the response ✅ FIXED

**Problem RESOLVED**:

- `/api/token/hide` now returns `{ success: true, updated: ids.length, data: updatedRows }`
- `toggleMoment` now returns the complete API response with updated data
- `HideButton` uses actual server response for accurate toast messages
- Complete data flow established: API → toggleMoment → HideButton

**Implementation Changes COMPLETED**:
[X] **Create branch**: `sweetmantech/myc-2318-apitokenhide-return-the-updated-rows-so-togglemoment-can`
[X] **Updated `updateInProcessTokens`** (`lib/supabase/in_process_tokens/updateInProcessTokens.ts`):

- Added `.select()` to Supabase update query to return updated rows
- Now returns the actual updated data instead of just success/error
  [X] **Updated `/api/token/hide`** (`app/api/token/hide/route.ts`):
- Captures `updatedRows` from `updateInProcessTokens` response
- Returns updated data in API response: `{ success, updated, data: updatedRows }`
  [X] **Updated `toggleMoment`** (`lib/timeline/toggleMoment.ts`):
- Changed return type from `Promise<void>` to `Promise<{ success: boolean; updated: number; data: any[] }>`
- Added proper error handling with response status checking
- Returns the complete API response for client consumption
  [X] **Updated `HideButton`** (`components/HorizontalFeed/HideButton.tsx`):
- Now uses `response.data[0].hidden` for toast message (actual server state)
- Toast shows accurate "Moment hidden" or "Moment revealed" based on server response
- Fallback to generic message if response structure is unexpected
- Proper error handling maintained

**Technical Flow IMPLEMENTED**:

1. **User clicks HideButton** → calls `toggleMoment(moment)`
2. **toggleMoment** → POSTs to `/api/token/hide` → returns response with updated data
3. **API** → calls `updateInProcessTokens` with `.select()` → returns updated rows
4. **HideButton** → uses `response.data[0].hidden` for accurate toast message
5. **Result**: Toast reflects the ACTUAL new state from server, not old client state

**Key Improvements**:

- **Accurate feedback**: Toast messages now reflect actual server state
- **Complete data flow**: From API response through to UI feedback
- **Better error handling**: Proper response validation and error messages
- **Type safety**: Updated function signatures with proper return types

**Branch & Commit**:

- Branch: `sweetmantech/myc-2318-apitokenhide-return-the-updated-rows-so-togglemoment-can`
- Commit: `c922ca7` - "[Cursor] Make /api/token/hide return updated rows for accurate toast messages (MYC-2318)"
- **Status**: ✅ Ready for PR creation

## Previous Task: Manage Page - Show All Moments Including Hidden Ones (MYC-2312)

Status: ✅ Complete ✅ Implementation Verified

**Issue RESOLVED**:

- When on `/manage` page and hide a moment, it now persists on refresh
- Current behavior: `/manage` route shows ALL tokens, including hidden tokens
- Requirement: **✅ COMPLETED**

**Root Cause Identified & Fixed**:

- **Problem**: `useTimelineApi.ts` → `fetchTimeline()` didn't pass `hidden` parameter, defaulting to only non-hidden moments
- **Solution**: Added `includeHidden` parameter throughout the chain

**Implementation Changes COMPLETED**:
[X] **Updated `useTimelineApi.ts`**: Added `includeHidden` parameter to `fetchTimeline` and `useTimelineApi`

- When `includeHidden=true`, passes `hidden="true"` to API
- Updated query key to include `includeHidden` for proper caching
  [X] **Updated `TimelineApiProvider.tsx`**: Added `includeHidden` prop and passed to `useTimelineApi`
  [X] **Updated `/manage/page.tsx`**: Added `includeHidden={true}` to show all moments including hidden ones
  [X] **Verified API Logic**: Confirmed `getInProcessTokens.ts` correctly handles `hidden` parameter:
- `hidden=false` (default) → filters to only non-hidden moments (`query.eq("hidden", false)`)
- `hidden=true` → NO filter applied → returns ALL moments (both hidden and non-hidden)

**Technical Flow VERIFIED**:

1. **Manage Page**: `<TimelineApiProvider includeHidden={true}>`
2. **Provider**: passes `includeHidden=true` to `useTimelineApi`
3. **Hook**: calls `fetchTimeline(page, limit, artistAddress, true)`
4. **API Call**: adds `hidden="true"` to URL params
5. **Backend**: receives `hidden=true` → `!hidden` = false → no filter applied
6. **Result**: Returns ALL moments (both hidden and non-hidden)

**Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**

- All code changes implemented correctly
- Logic verified through code analysis
- API behavior confirmed to work as expected
- Testing blocked only by environment setup issues (canvas dependency failure)
