## How to Use This Scratchpad

When you receive a new task:
1. **Review** the Scratchpad content
2. **Clear** old completed tasks if necessary
3. **Explain** the new task
4. **Plan** the steps needed to complete it
5. Use todo markers to track progress: `[X] Task 1` / `[ ] Task 2`

**IMPORTANT**: Update the Scratchpad CONTINUOUSLY as you work:
- When you start a new task → review, clear old tasks, plan steps
- When you complete a subtask → mark it complete immediately
- When you make progress → update the status section
- When you finish a milestone → reflect and plan next steps
- When planning next actions → always refer to Scratchpad first

Also update the progress of the task in the Scratchpad when you finish a subtask.
Especially when you finished a milestone, it will help to improve your depth of task accomplishment to use the Scratchpad to reflect and plan.
The goal is to help you maintain a big picture as well as the progress of the task. Always refer to the Scratchpad when you plan the next step.
