# In Process

> A Web3-native platform for documenting and monetizing the creative journey—not just the final product.

In Process is a living archive of artistic evolution where artists, builders, and creatives can upload their work-in-progress and mint it onchain to a collective timeline. Your community, fans, and patrons can collect, comment, and support work as it unfolds.

## What Makes In Process Different

- Focus on process, not polish
- Permanent, onchain documentation
- Monetization of in-progress work
- Decentralized, artist-owned timelines
- Support for both Web2 and Web3 users
- Cross-platform embedding of content (onchain + offchain)

## What Content Can You Post

You can upload any part of your creative process:
- Journals, notes, poetry
- Demos, drafts, audio clips
- Sketches, moodboards, visuals
- Behind-the-scenes footage, vlogs
- External links and embeds (YouTube, NFTs, Instagram, Google Docs, etc.)

## Timeline Features

- Posts can be backdated (e.g., a sketch from 2021)
- Posts can be future-dated (e.g., a concept for a 2026 project)
- Posts can be time-stamped to the present
- Your personal timeline feeds into the Collective Timeline
