# In Process

> A collective onchain timeline where artists own their creative evolution. Built by LATASH√Å, In Process is not content, it's record-keeping, proof, and legacy. Artists document their creative process in real time, onchain, on their terms.

In Process revolutionizes how artists interact with digital art by giving them true ownership of their timeline and process. Every sketch, verse, sound, and glitch becomes a permanent timestamp in culture. Built on Base blockchain using a fork of the Zora ERC1155 Protocol, the platform combines social features with onchain permanence.

**Core Philosophy**: "THE TIMELINE WAS NEVER THEIRS. IT WAS ALWAYS OURS." - In Process refuses the traditional model where algorithms control artist visibility and archives. Instead, artists own their evolution with permanent, onchain documentation.
